ANSI / Xterm 256 color library for Dart
------

Feel like you're missing some color in your terminal programs? Use AnsiPen to add ANSI color codes to your log messages.  

Easy to disable for production, just set the global `color_disabled = true` and all codes will be empty - no re-writing debug messages.  

Example
------
Note: Be mindful of contrasting colors.  If you set "bright white" foreground and don't adjust the background, you'll have a bad time with lighter terminals.  

Foreground to bright white with default background:
```dart
AnsiPen pen = new AnsiPen()..white(bold: true);
print(pen("Bright white foreground") + " this text is default fg/bg");
```

Background as a peach, foreground as white:
```dart
AnsiPen pen = new AnsiPen()..white()..rgb(r: 1.0, g: 0.8, b: 0.2);
print(pen("White foreground with a peach background"));
```

Rainbow Demo
------

If you want a specific color, you can call the `xterm()` with the index listed in the rainbow below. To show the rainbow on your own terminal, just call `print(ansi_demo());` or run src/demo.dart
